# This directory contains predictions for the lensing extraction noise
  spectrum (more precisely, the theoretical residual noise on the
  deflection field N_l^dd) computed for LiteBird under various
  assumptions (sensitivity, beam, fidvuial model) with the code
  FuturCMB available at http://lpsc.in2p3.fr/perotto (we actually used
  a version modified by T. Brinckmann and D.C. Hooper, compatible with
  more recent versions of CosmoMC and with few extra features)

# Directory structure:

* `fiducials` contains the Cl's and the corresponding CLASS input file
  for the fiducial model passed in input to FUTURCMB.

* `FUTURCMB_input` contains the FUTURCMB input files used for
  generating the noise curves

* `FUTURCMB_output` contains the output noise curves generated by
  FUTURCMB. The files with extension `.dat` contain:

  ell | NlTT | NlPP | Nldd | ClTT | ClTE | ClEE | Cldd | ClTd | fsky

  The `.dataset` logs a summary of the input file.

* `noise-for-mcmc` contains the noise curves that we will use for
  MCMC, that is the combination of the file
  `litebird_lowE_fgres_and_noise.dat` and the output of FUTURCMB. The
  file contains (last column is not meant to be used):

  ell | NlTT | NlPP | Nldd | ClTT+NlTT
