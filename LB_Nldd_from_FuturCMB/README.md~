# Directory structure
* `fiducials` contains the Cl's and the corresponding CLASS input file for our fiducial model used by FUTURCMB.
* `input` contains the FUTURCMB input files used in the generating the noise curves
* `output` contains the output noise curves generated by FUTURCMB, the noise curves themselves have the file extension `.dat` and the fiducial Cl+Nl is written to the files with the extension `.dataset`
* `noise-for-mcmc` contains the noise curves that we will use for MCMC, that is the combination of the file `litebird_lowE_fgres_and_noise.dat` and the output of FUTURCMB.
