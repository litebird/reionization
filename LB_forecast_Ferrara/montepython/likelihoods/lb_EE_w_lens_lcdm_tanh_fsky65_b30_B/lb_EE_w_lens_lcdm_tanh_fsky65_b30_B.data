# fiducial model, not containing any actual Planck data,

# for the full Planck mission.

# This likelihood is based on the fake_planck_bluebook
# likelihood, modified by T. Brinckmann and S. Clesse
# adding extra options implemented for the core_m5 papers,
# e.g. lensing extraction, de-lensing, or B-modes.
